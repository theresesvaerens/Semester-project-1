# Community Science Museum — Semester Project 1
This project was developed as my Semester Project in the first year of Front-End Development. The task was to design and build a modern, accessible and responsive website for an interactive science museum aimed at children and families.

The goal of the website is to inspire curiosity, excitement and encourage visitors to explore the museum.

# Project Purpose
The objective of this project was to create a complete web presence for the Community Science Museum, including:
- A modern and visually appealing design
- A responsive layout for all devices
- Accessible and semantic HTML
- A clear structure based on user needs
- A design language that appeals to ages 7–15 and families

No JavaScript or CSS frameworks were allowed, ensuring a focus on HTML, CSS and fundamental front-end skills.

- A visitor can view a home page with essential museum information and imagery
